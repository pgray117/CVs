								I have a deep interest in technology, combined with an ability to communicate complicated ideas succinctly, I am seeking to bring these varying attributes to a role within the field of software analysis.
								I also have a background in technical support and customer service as well as keen analytical skills gained from a degree in English Literature and roles as a technology journalist. 
								My background in customer service means that I look at problems from an end users perspective, a talent that I use to inform my testing approach.
